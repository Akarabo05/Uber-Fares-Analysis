# Uber Fares Data Analysis Dashboard and Overview

>This project analyzes the Uber Fares dataset to uncover meaningful trends in fare behavior, ride timing, and high-demand periods the Kaggle Uber Fares dataset. Data preprocessing and feature engineering were carried out using Python, while Power BI was used to design an interactive dashboard that presents key insights through dynamic visualizations.

## Feature Engineering Highlights

- Extracted:
  - `hour`, `day`, `month`, `weekday`, `year` from `pickup_datetime`
- Created:
  - `peak_hour` indicator
  - `trip_distance` using Haversine formula
- Encoded:
  - Day names (`weekday_label`)
  - Peak vs Off-Peak hours

##  Key Insights

- Fare amounts are highest during **peak hours (7â€“9AM and 5â€“7PM)**
- Most rides have 1â€“2 passengers; average fare increases slightly with count
- Fare is **linearly correlated with distance**, as expected
- Weekends show slightly higher fare variability

---
## Recommendations
Enhance driver availability during peak hours to effectively meet increased rider demand and reduce wait times.

Introduce off-peak fare discounts to encourage higher ridership during slower periods and balance demand throughout the day.

Leverage ride trend insights to develop targeted marketing campaigns and optimize incentive programs based on rider behavior.
